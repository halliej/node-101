# What is Node.js
 * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (node) is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code outside of the Chrome browser.
 * Originally developed by Ryan Dahl of Joyent in 2009.
 * Additional native and javascript code provides non-browser functionality.
 * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), a package manager and repository for the JavaScript programming language, was released in 2010. 
 * Node development is supported under the guidlines of the Linux Foundation. 
 
# Reasons to use node
* Event driven
* Non blocking I/O
* Single threaded
* ES6+
* Built-in modules
* NPM repository
* Same language across the stack
* Open Source

# Reasons to not use node
* Multiple threads
* Long running computations
* Static files
* Need to touch hardware
* Language 'X' does 'Y' better
* NPM repository

<b>NOTE:</b> there are workarounds for most of these...
